docker start example:

docker run --gpus all -v /data:/data:ro -v /data/wdata:/wdata --ipc=host -it cannab

Model weights will be downloaded on docker start.

test.sh takes ~3 hours, but should be faster with good ssd drive. I've tested on p3.8xlarge - main delays come from disk i/o.

train.sh takes ~2 days, but also tested and should be in time.

To reproduce train need to use all 6 cities from SN3 and SN4 (use 6 argumets for train.sh)!

All logs saved to /wdata/logs folder
